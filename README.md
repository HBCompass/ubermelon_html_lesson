ubermelon_html_lesson
=====================

##Instructions
Take a look at ubermelon_screenshot.png. Try to make a webpage that duplicates this screenshot using HTML and CSS.

**Don't** look at index.html or main.css just yet!

##Extra Credit
1. If you haven't tried this already, make your CSS style sheet externally linked with a link tag.
2. Clone this repo and open up index.html with a browser (*not* Sublime). Now resize your browser window. See how the image and columns change size? That's called responsive design. Make your web page resize in the same way.
3. If you're really feeling fancy, try to use a custom font from Google Fonts.
4. Extra extra credit: build this page using Twitter Bootstrap.
